Get daily emails that become irrelevant after a week? Why see them in your inbox, This archives messages with a label after a week.


I get alot of email's like this:

However I don't really need them after they get a week old. I do want to keep them however, Notice how they are tagged as "decay". This means that this script can after a week archive them and they won't appear in the main inbox. Useful!
